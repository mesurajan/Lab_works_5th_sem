Lab Question: Build a Job Application Form Webpage

**Objective:**  
Create a job application form webpage using HTML and CSS. The form should collect essential information 
from applicants, be user-friendly, and have a professional design suitable for a company website.

**Requirements:**

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<form>`, `<footer>`) to structure the page.
   - Include the following sections:
     - A header with a title (e.g., "Job Application Form - [Company Name]").
     - A brief introduction paragraph (e.g., "Join our team! Please fill out the form below to apply.").
     - A `<form>` element containing the following input fields:
       - Full Name (text input, required).
       - Email Address (email input, required).
       - Phone Number (tel input, optional).
       - Position Applying For (dropdown `<select>` with at least 3 options, e.g., "Software Engineer", "Marketing Specialist", "Customer Support").
       - Years of Experience (number input, required)
       - Resume Upload (file input for uploading a resume, accept `.pdf` and `.docx` files).
       - Employment Type (Select dropdown: part time, fulltime)
       - A "Submit Application" button.
   - Use appropriate attributes like `required`, `placeholder`, and `type` to enhance functionality.

2. **CSS Styling:**
   - Apply a professional color scheme (e.g., neutral tones like gray, white, and a primary accent color).
   - Style the header with a background color and center the title.
   - Set a maximum width for the form (e.g., `600px`) and center it on the page with padding and a subtle border or background.
   - Style form elements for clarity:
     - Labels should be aligned above or beside inputs (your choice).
     - Inputs and textarea should have consistent padding, borders, and font size.
     - Dropdown and button should match the color scheme.

**Submission Guidelines:**
- Prepare a lab report describing forms elements in html.
- Submit two files: `job-application.html` and `job-application.css`.
- Test your webpage in a browser to ensure the form is functional and styled correctly.
