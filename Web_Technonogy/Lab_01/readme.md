Lab Question: Build a Recipe Webpage

Objective:

Create a visually appealing recipe webpage using HTML and CSS. The webpage should display a recipe 
of your choice, including a title, description, ingredients list, step-by-step instructions, and 
an optional image.

Requirements:

HTML Structure:

Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>) to organize the content.
Include the following sections:
A header with the recipe title (e.g., "Chocolate Chip Cookies").
A short description or introduction to the recipe (1-2 sentences).
An ingredients section with a bulleted list of at least 5 ingredients.
A steps section with a numbered list of at least 4 preparation steps.


CSS Styling:

Apply a consistent color scheme (e.g., background color, text color).
Style the header with a background color and center the title.
Use a maximum width for the main content (e.g., 800px) and center it on the page.
Format the ingredients and steps lists for readability (e.g., adjust spacing, font size).
Add padding and margins to create a clean layout.
Style the image (if included) with a border and a maximum width of 400px.


Submission Guidelines:

Write a proper lab report describing usages of all the tags and styles used in the web page. You can print the code and output but write the description with your own hand.
Submit two files: recipe.html and recipe.css.
Test your webpage in a browser to ensure it displays correctly.
